Feel free to contribute to this repository!

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists at https://github.com/FJrodafo/CV/issues. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull/merge request with a fix at https://github.com/FJrodafo/CV/pulls. To work on the pull request, fork the repository at https://github.com/FJrodafo/CV/forks.

Please do not copy questions and answers from other sources, they probably worked hard to add them, and if you add new images, make sure they are free and usable.
